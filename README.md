Welcome to my repository "Introductions to Robotics", taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. In this repository you will find my laboratory homeworks and each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code, image and video files. I hope you find it easy to look through my repository.
