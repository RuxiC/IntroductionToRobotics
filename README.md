# IntroductionToRobotics (2023-2024)

Welcome to my repository "Introductions to Robotics", taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. In this repository you will find my laboratory homeworks and each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code, image and video files. I hope you find it easy to look through my repository.

**Enjoy your journey through it!**

## hw1_RGB_LED_ThreePotentiometer
This homework focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of an RGB LED using individual potentiometers and sets the LED color intensity accordingly to their values. For this task I used an RGB LED, 3 potentiometres, 3 resistors and wires.
